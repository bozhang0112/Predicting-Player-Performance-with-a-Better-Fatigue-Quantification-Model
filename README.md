This project is to analyze the role of workload and fatigue for the dataset of the Canadian National Women's Rugby Team in Rugby 7s, which is a fast-paced, physically demanding sport that pushes the limits of athlete speed, endurance and toughness. 
Data wrangling, visualizations, transformations has been processed to the data. Multiple linear regression has been constructed to analyze the factor that will have a significant influence on the fatigue value. Limitations and conclusion has been made in the end.
